        <h3>How to Store Chocolate Chip Banana Bread</h3>
        <div>
        <p>
            Chocolate chip banana bread will last for about four days
            if you store it properly. Place a paper towel at the bottom
            of an airtight container or in a zip-top bag. Place the cooled
            banana bread on top of it, then cover the loaf with another
            paper towel. Seal the container tightly.

        <h3>Can You Freeze Chocolate Chip Banana Bread?</h3>
        <div>
            <P>
            Yes, you can freeze chocolate chip banana bread! Wrap the cooled
            loaf tightly in one layer of storage wrap, then one layer of
            aluminum foil. You can also freeze each slice individually if you
            don't plan to thaw the whole loaf at once.
        </P>
