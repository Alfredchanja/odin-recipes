            if you store it properly. Place a paper towel at the bottom
            of an airtight container or in a zip-top bag. Place the cooled
            banana bread on top of it, then cover the loaf with another
            paper towel. Seal the container tightly.

            aluminum foil. You can also freeze each slice individually if you
            don't plan to thaw the whole loaf at once.
